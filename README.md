## Frontend

* #### Django template language
    Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable to those used to working with HTML. If you have any exposure to other text-based template languages, such as Smarty or Jinja2, you should feel right at home with Django’s templates.
    

## Backend

* #### Django 
    Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It's free and open source.
    
    * ###### Why Django ?
        *  Ridiculously fast
        *  Reassuringly secure
        *  Exceedingly scalable
        *  Incredibly versatile
        *  Easy to Integrate with Python Libraries/Functions
